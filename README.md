# Hi, I'm Ayesha 👋

### Cloud Security Engineer • Cloud Solutions Architect • AWS Community Builder

I design, break, and secure cloud environments for a living—always chasing the next level of resilience and efficiency. My professional playground spans AWS, Azure, and on‑prem integrations, where I translate business risk into practical, auditable architectures.

## What I'm focused on right now 🔭

* **Hybrid‑cloud security architecture**—bringing together AWS, Azure, and legacy estates.
* **OT security** for critical infrastructure.
* Leveling‑up every day on emerging cyber‑security tactics & tools.

---

## Tech Toolbox 🛠️

* **Cloud:** AWS, Azure
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, CloudFormation, JSON templates
* **Languages & Scripting:** Python, Bash/sh
* **Security & Ops:** Kali Linux, threat modeling, automated compliance

## Beyond the Console 🌱

When the terminal closes you'll probably find me:

* sketching or DIY‑ing random arts & crafts;
* experimenting in the kitchen;
* wandering around new places with no clear destination (best ideas happen there!).

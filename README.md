### 🏛 AWS Community Builder
### ☁️ Cloud Solutions Architect

🏗️By profession, I am working as a Cloud Security Engineer. Experienced in Cloud Solution Architecture Design, System Administration, Security, and Automation. 

🚀Currently, I am working to discover Secure ways of architecting Cloud Solutions, Systems Engineering, and ways to understand the Business impact of these solutions.

🌏I love sharing my knowledge with beginners that's why I started documenting my knowledge on a Tech Blog [CloudedBytes.com]([url](https://cloudedbytes.com/)).

🥂Being an AWS Community Builder is a great honor that allowed me to equip Cloud Enthusiasts with great knowledge of AWS and the possibilities it holds.

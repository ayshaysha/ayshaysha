## [~]$ WhoAmI

### 🏛 AWS Community Builder
### ☁️ Cloud Solutions Architect

🏗️By profession, I am working as a Cloud DevOps Engineer, also leading my own team of Cloud Engineers. Experienced in Application System Administration, DevOps, Security, and Automations. 

🚀I am currently exploring skills related to AWS Cloud, DevOps, and Cloud Security. My aim is to specialize in Cloud Native Solution Architecture Designing.

🌏I love sharing my knowledge with beginners that's why I started writing an IT Blog [aysharshad.com](https://aysharshad.com/).

🥂Being an AWS Community Builder is a great honour that allowed me to equip Cloud Enthusiasts with the great knowledge of AWS and the possibilities it holds.
